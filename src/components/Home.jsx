          <h2>What is the Student Council?</h2>
          <p>
            The Student Council is a group of elected students who represent their fellow students,
            allow their peers to voice their concerns, and work with the school to improve
            the school environment. They help organize school events, propose policies,
            and act as a bridge between students and faculty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Members of the council work on initiatives such as school improvements,
            extracurricular activities, and fundraising efforts. Their leadership skills, teamwork, and connections make a significant impact on the student community.

          <h2>Why Should You Vote?</h2>
          <p>
            Your vote matters! By taking part in the election, you are choosing
            the leaders who will advocate for your needs, propose new ideas,
            and bring about positive or negative change for you. Every vote influences
            the future of your student life and rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            Voting is not just about selecting a candidate; it's about selecting a future
            for your school experience. The right leaders can introduce programs, plan
            exciting events, and ensure student voices are heard.
